        <h2>Version 1.0</h2>
        <p>Open Source release</p>
        <p>February 2021</p>
    <br/>

    <p>Thanks for choosing this App!</p>
        <p>PianoToner was born as a reference sine tone generator to tune acoustic pianos while I was working as an illegal (:P) piano tuner in Stuttgart.</p>
        <p>You know, thatÂ´s a really long story, full of drinks, lots of work at nights shifts in a pub, drunken neighbours in the hotel corridor...</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Version History</p>
        <p>The initial development of this small app began in the year 2018, as an iOS version with advertising.</p>
    <p>Since then, lots of things have changed, I made an Android version, almost 99% similar (not really in the graphical aspect, but in functionality),</p>
    <p>in Juli 2020 I released the last closed source version, and finally in February 2021 I decided to opt in favour of Open Source code and publish the source code on GitHub.</p>
