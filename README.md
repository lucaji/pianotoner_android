# pianotoner android version

A native Android tone generator for tuning stringed instruments.
It was born as a piano tuning assistant, so it's name ended up being a contraction of piano tone/tuner...

This is a little reduced version of the original iOS version.

## OVERVIEW

This is a native Android app, written in Java and Kotlin.

It uses the JSyn library for tone generator.
